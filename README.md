# 🔥 Thermal Inspection of Solar Panels using AI & IBM Maximo

> A real-time, AI-powered defect detection system for solar panels using thermal imaging, IBM Maximo Visual Inspection, and live Grafana dashboards — developed as part of IBM Consulting Internship 2025.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Solar panel efficiency can drastically drop due to invisible thermal defects like hot spots, cracks, and air gaps. Manual inspections using IR cameras are time-consuming and error-prone.

This project solves that by leveraging **AI-powered thermal image processing** using **IBM Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI)** and **YOLOv3**, combined with a real-time analytics and alerting pipeline using **Flask**, **SQLite**, **MQTT**, **Docker**, and **Grafana**.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Automate thermal inspections of solar panels.
- Identify potential defects (hot/cold spots, cracks, air gaps).
- Provide real-time alerts and visualization dashboards.
- Improve precision, speed, and energy efficiency.
